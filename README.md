##About the software
The OpenStreetMap PathFinder allows you to compute itinerary for pedestrians, bycicles and
motorized vehicules on maps from OpenStreetMap.

It can extract data from OSM files and display the path you requested in two formats :
 - A graphical and visual format stored in a jpeg file.
 - A textual format that gives you a roadmap discribing your itinerary.

This project is a study work realized in team at _University Paris Diderot, Paris 7_.
